EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Global Climate Research Initiative (GCRI) represents the largest international collaboration in climate science history, bringing together over 500 researchers from 45 countries. Led by Dr. Elena Rodriguez from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the initiative aims to develop comprehensive climate models that integrate atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial systems.

LEADERSHIP TEAM

The project is co-directed by Dr. Elena Rodriguez (MIT), Prof. James Chen (Stanford University), and Dr. Marie Dubois (Sorbonne University, Paris). The technical advisory board includes Dr. Michael Brown from the University of Oxford, Dr. Lisa Wang from Beijing University, and Prof. Carlos Santos from the University of São Paulo.

Key department heads include:
- Atmospheric Modeling: Dr. Sarah Johnson (NOAA, Boulder, Colorado)
- Ocean Dynamics: Prof. Thomas Anderson (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution)
- Terrestrial Systems: Dr. Priya Patel (Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore)
- Data Integration: Dr. Alex Müller (Max Planck Institute, Hamburg)
